# Web Scraping with ShipInfo data

The **Web-Scraping-ShipInfo** module consists of a python-based Jupyter-notebook 
designed to demonstrate the use of web scraping techniques to get Ship Details, such as Name, IMO, MMSI or Type, from the ShipInfo Website to be able to cross check another source of information. 



The idea behind this code is to obtain as much information as possible while one is working with AIS data, data which usually some values are missed and it should be a nice procedure to compare with other sources of information.
